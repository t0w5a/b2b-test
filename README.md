### <a name="description"></a>1. Description
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.2.  
It represents the test task for B2Broker. The task itself is located within [test.pdf](test.pdf) file.

### <a name="installation"></a>2. Installation

To install the application, you have to run the following command within the project's root folder:
```bash
npm install
```

### <a name="running"></a>3. Run application
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.  
  
### <a name="tests"></a>4. Run tests
In order to run unit tests (jasmine), use this command: `npm run test`.  
There are only two unit tests implemented with 100% coverage:
- `src/app/services/transactions.service.spec.ts` - service
- `src/app/components/settings-controls/settings-controls.component.spec.ts` - component  
  All other tests are skipped due to the lack of time.  
  The above unit tests should be enough to give you an understanding of my skills in writing unit tests.
